# OpenSearch Hadoop
OpenSearch real-time search and analytics natively integrated with Hadoop.
Supports [Map/Reduce](#mapreduce), [Apache Hive](#apache-hive), [Apache Spark](#apache-spark).

- [OpenSearch Hadoop](#opensearch-hadoop)
  - [Requirements](#requirements)
  - [Usage](#usage)
  - [Compatibility](#compatibility)
  - [Building the source](#building-the-source)
  - [License](#license)

## Requirements
OpenSearch (__1.3.x__ or higher) cluster accessible through REST. That's it!
If using SigV4 IAM auth features, you would need to include the following AWS SDK v2 dependencies in your job classpath:
- `software.amazon.awssdk:auth:2.31.59` (or later)
- `software.amazon.awssdk:regions:2.31.59` (or later)
- `software.amazon.awssdk:http-client-spi:2.31.59` (or later)
- `software.amazon.awssdk:identity-spi:2.31.59` (or later)
- `software.amazon.awssdk:sdk-core:2.31.59` (or later)
- `software.amazon.awssdk:utils:2.31.59` (or later)

## Usage

Please see the [USER_GUIDE](USER_GUIDE.md) for usage.

## Compatibility

See [Compatibility](COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Building the source

OpenSearch Hadoop uses [Gradle][] for its build system and it is not required to have it installed on your machine. By default (`gradlew`), it automatically builds the package and runs the unit tests. For integration testing, use the `integrationTests` task.
See `gradlew tasks` for more information.

To create a distributable zip, run `gradlew distZip` from the command line; once completed you will find the jar in `build/libs`.

To build the project, JVM 8, JVM 11, and JVM 17 are required. The minimum compiler version is Java 14 and the minimum runtime is Java 8.
